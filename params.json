{"name":"Tapkee","tagline":"Benchmarks and comparisons","body":"This repository includes [a script](benchmark.py) that can be used to \r\nbenchmark various implementations of dimension reduction algorithms. Currently the\r\nscript supports three modes:\r\n\r\n- *jmlr*. Reproduce comparison table from the JMLR MLOSS submission of paper on Tapkee.\r\n- *all*. Run all Tapkee algorithms on all included datasets and output walltime.\r\n- *scaling*. Measure speedups caused by increasing number of used threads.\r\n\r\nTo run the script with some mode use `python benchmark.py [mode]` where mode is any of the modes listed above.\r\n\r\nThis repository also includes methods availability table that can be found [here](available_methods.md).\r\n\r\nIncluded libraries:\r\n\r\n- [Tapkee](http://lisitsyn.github.com/tapkee/). This repository includes binary of application from the Tapkee library v0.1. Requires no installation.\r\n\r\n- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/). This repository includes Scikit-learn v.0.13.1 with no patches applied. To install Scikit-learn\r\ncd to scikit-learn/sklearn and run `python setup.py build` and `sudo python setup.py install` commands.\r\n\r\n- [Waffles](http://waffles.sourceforge.net/). This repository includes version 2012-08-31 of Waffles library with small patch to support\r\ntime measuring. To build Waffles cd to `waffles/src` and run `sudo make install` command. After that, binaries will \r\nbe located in the `waffles/bin/` folder.\r\n\r\n- [Matlab Toolbox for Dimensionality Reduction (MTfDR)](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/19j49/Matlab_Toolbox_for_Dimensionality_Reduction.html). This \r\nrepository includes `MTfDR v.08 April 2012` without any changes. MTfDR requires no installation.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nIncluded libraries are distributed under their own licenses without any changes from our side.
